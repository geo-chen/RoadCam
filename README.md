## Finding 2 - CVE-2025-30123: Hardcoded FTP Credentials in APK 
The ROADCAM X3 dashcamâ€™s mobile app (Viidure v1.5) contains hardcoded FTP credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the device's file system. Using the username "FTPX," an attacker can log in remotely and download all recorded video footage, exposing sensitive data.
